Task: Understand the RRT algorithm (you would need to explain it in the interview) Implement the algorithm considering: State Space: The state space is (x,y), i.e. 2 degrees of freedom. Start and goal would be specified in (x,y) coordinates. Language of implementation: C++ or Python. Implement in the language you are best at.
